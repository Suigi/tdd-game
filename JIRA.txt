## Cleanup Work
[ ] Get rid of front-end module, make it a single module project

[ ] Remove the idea of an "opponent", games can have anywhere from 1-6 players
[ ] (think) get rid of CardId?
[ ] Separate the Application layer from the Domain
    [ ] Move PORT to application
    [ ] Split out card shuffle (RandomCardShuffler) into PORT and ADAPTER
    [ ] Pull in ArchUnit

## Game Layout

Per Game:
* TILEs
* ACTION CARD DECK
* ACTION CARD DISCARD PILE
* TEST RESULTS DECK
* TEST RESULTS DISCARD PILE
* 6-SIDED DIE

Per Player:
* PAWN (indicates which TILE they're on)
* HAND
* PLAY AREA
* TECH NEGLECT AREA
* COMMIT TRACKER
* RISK TRACKER

Player's "State Machine":
    Player's "TURN" is complete when either: play/discard 3 cards OR explicitly END TURN

## Need

[ ] Structure for the BOARD as 9 separate TILEs,
    [ ] PLAYER is ON a TILE (has a game state machine)
    [ ] player's COMMAND causes change, potentially transition to new TILE
        [ ] MOVE PAWN - moves the player to a new tile
        [ ] DRAW CARD (and DRAW FULL)
        [ ] DISCARD CARD (often causes a transition)
        [ ] PLAY CARD
        [ ] END TURN
