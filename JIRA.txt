## Cleanup Work
[ ] Get rid of front-end module, make it a single module project

[ ] Remove the idea of an "opponent", games can have anywhere from 1-6 players
[ ] (think) get rid of CardId?
[ ] Separate the Application layer from the Domain
    [ ] Move PORT to application
    [ ] Split out card shuffle (RandomCardShuffler) into PORT and ADAPTER
    [ ] Pull in ArchUnit

## Need

[ ] Structure for the BOARD as 9 separate TILEs
    [ ] TILE has rules for exit, sometimes multiple exits
        [ ] Exits have either precondition (discarded a card)
            or a post-condition (increases cycle risk)
